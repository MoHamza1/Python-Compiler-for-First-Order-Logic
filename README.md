COMP2211 Compiler design part of Networks and Systems
# First order logic parser (achieved 95%)

## Get up and running

The dependencies for this project are matplotlib, network, and pygraphviz.

These should all be available on mds computers.

Alternatively, to install pygraphviz, install brew from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)on your Linux/macOS machine and install pygraphviz by typing brew install graphviz

To run the parser first

1. cd into the directory containing parser.py
2. type `python parser.py <path to input file>`
- e.g. `python parser.py ./example.txt`
  
## What to expect

There will be two outputs into the current directory both time-stamped in their name when created to avoid writing over old files:

1. A log file: &quot;parse\_log Fri Mar 6 04/28/50 2020.log&quot;
  - A complete pre order traversal of the syntax tree
    - Or an incomplete one in the case of encountering an error
    - Note: no traversal will be given if the formula is found to be invalid before attempting to build the tree.
  - A list of error messages, shown recursively similar to how python gives error messages. <img src="parse_tree Wed May 13 13:41:01 2020.png" width="800" />![image](/parse_tree Wed May 13 13:41:01 2020.png)

2. A PNG file: `parse\_tree Fri Mar 6 04/28/50 2020.png`;
  - Showing the parse tree for the formula, if it is valid.
  - And the original formula at the top.

3. A txt file: `grammar Fri Mar 6 04/28/51 2020.txt`, containing the grammar of this specific input file.

## 3. Parser.py file structure

The project consists of 2 classes, formula and userDefinedSyntax. 2 functions, log\_error and formula\_to\_graph.

- userDefinedSyntax parses the desired input file,
  - finds any errors in variable/constant/predicate declarations explained further in section 4.
- Formula is a class with multiple formula objects as its &#39;children&#39;
  - it is essentially a recursive function in so far as the constructor,
  - each child object of the root formula object has a type and a value and optionally a child(ren).
  - but obviously not for individual atoms (in FOL it would be either a constant or a variable).
- log\_error is a two-line function,
  - its sole purpose is to simplify the codebase to make logging errors more understandable.
- formula\_to\_graph takes an instance of the formula class and recursively expands on the object&#39;s children, adding the relevant nodes to the networkX graph declared globally.

## 4. Error checking

The parser should be able to parse any of your favourite FO formulae, I will quickly outline the kind of error checking the parser is doing:

- While parsing the input file
  - finds any errors in variable/constant/predicate declarations,
  - such as having non-alphanumeric/underscores names,
  - or a predicate declared with a non-numeric arity,
  - or if there are any duplicate name declarations in the file.
  - There are the suitable number of logical connectives

- While parsing the formula
  - Logical connectives have been negated
  - Predicates used in a formula that have not been declared in the syntax
  - Unexpected number of arguments given to a predicate.
  - Constants being used as arguments for predicates.
  - Attempting to quantify a constant

- Building the tree
  - Any uncaught errors in my understanding of the grammar of first order logic, or otherwise in the syntax or formula. This is clear as any node that is not a term (constant or variable) must have at least one child. The error log will reflect on the exact formula sub formula of the original input where the error was encountered.

## 5. Notes

- I was having a lot of problems with encoding backslashes in the python file with regex and otherwise, for this reason I strip all predicates, variable names qualifiers etc. of it. It was extremely unstable since it more often than not failed in string comparisons of two identical strings.
- I use pygraphviz to give the tree the hierarchical structure it has since the fixed positions I gave by doing an in-order traversal of the graph occasionally had overlapping edges when the plot was made on a low-resolution machine, where the root node had any more than 40 children
- At a few points I reference the different &#39;cases&#39; of the formula given to the constructor

1. case 1: Â¬formula
2. case 2: primative\_formula
3. case 3: quantifier variable formula
4. case 4: Term
5. case 5: formula connective formula

- These are outlined more in the grammar file, but for clarities sake:
  - A term is a variable or constant. A primitive formula is predicate function that takes any sequence of terms as a parameter (Constants are excluded later for more meaningful error messages; the length of the sequence is also checked).
  - Note: the grammar states formula -\&gt; (formula), this is allowed as all parentheses are stripped in my implementation, I did not realise the invalidity that it would make in your FOL grammar, and assumed that since it makes sense semantically it would take too much re-working of the formula class to find redundant braces for only certain cases.
